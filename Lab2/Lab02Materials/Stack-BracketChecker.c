// BRACKETCHECKER.C [200716]
// This program illustrates the use of a stack for something other than
// just storing integers.
//
// You will notice that this code is generously (excessively?) commented.
// This is to provide the reader with a detailed narrative as they read
// through the code. Hopefully the comments help with your understanding
// of what we are trying to accomplish.
//
// Program reads a C source file, character by character. If an opening
// bracket is found, information about the bracket is pushed on the stack.
// If a closing bracket is found, then we pop the last opening bracket
// off the stack and verify that the type is correct.  If not, we report
// an error and quit.
//

// This code introduces a couple of constructs:
// #define - to create a little piece of easy-to-understand code
// enum - to create a variable with values from a set of named values.

#include <stdio.h>

// Some code shortcuts
#define isopenbracket(c)	(c=='{' || c=='[' || c=='(')
#define isclosebracket(c)	(c=='}' || c==']' || c==')')

// The C declaration "enum" lets the programmer create a type with named
// values. This can be helpful in making programs more readable. In the
// following use, I specify an enumerated type (not a variable - yet) 
// "enum bracket_types" and a list of possible values:
// CURLY, SQUARE or ROUND.
// Later I can declare a variable of type enum bracket_types. The compiler
// will enforce the rule that the variable can only be assigned one of the
// values listed in the type declaration. It's a language feature to
// help make code easier to read.

enum bracket_types		{ CURLY, SQUARE, ROUND };
enum bracket_position	{ OPEN, CLOSE };

// Handy code to provide printable names given bracket type
char *bracket_name (enum bracket_types brt)
{
	switch (brt)	{
	case CURLY:		return "Curly";
	case SQUARE:	return "Square";
	case ROUND:		return "Round";
	default:		return "UNKNOWN";
		}
}//bracket_name()


// Tables are a useful way of organizing information. This table records what
// we need to know about bracket characters
struct table	{
	char					ch;		// actual bracket character
	enum bracket_types		type;	// what type of bracket is this
	enum bracket_position	posn;	// is it an opening or closing bracket
	};

// Here's another bit of useful syntax - the "typedef" construct. What it
// does is creates a name for an existing type - essentially to make it
// easier to type, understand, etc. One place you see it used in my code
// is to (almost) eliminate the need to type the word struct.

typedef struct table	Table, *pTable;

// What this means is that if I type "Table", it is the same as if I typed
// "struct table".  The second word in the list of declarations is
// interesting - this syntax means if I type "pTable", it is the same as
// if I typed "struct table *" - meaning a pointer to a struct table.  So
// I now have type Table which is a struct table, and type pTable which is
// type struct table *. Think about this as you read the table definition
// and the lookup function below.

// Populate a bracket table. This is an array of 6 table structures. Each 
// structure is initialized with the actual bracket character, what type of
// bracket it is, and whether it is an OPENing or CLOSEing version of the
// bracket type.

Table	bracket_table [6]	=	{
		{	'{',	CURLY,		OPEN	},
		{	'}',	CURLY,		CLOSE	},
		{	'[',	SQUARE,		OPEN	},
		{	']',	SQUARE,		CLOSE	},
		{	'(',	ROUND,		OPEN	},
		{	')',	ROUND,		CLOSE	}
	};
// For clarity, I am going to put a function here that uses the
// bracket_table. The function looks up a character to see if it is in
// the table, and if it is, provides access to the table entry so the
// attributes of the bracket can be accessed.
// (I put this function here because this code only needs the bracket_table
// to do its work.)

pTable lookup (char c)
// Using bracket_table, look up the character c given as parameter. If c is
// a bracket listed in the table, function returns pointer to the table
// entry. If c is not a bracket character listed, returns NULL.
{
	int		i;

	// Go through all 6 entries in the bracket_table array
	for (i=0; i<6; i++)	{
		// check if we found the character we were given. If so, we are
		// done and we can return a pointer to the table entry with the
		// information about the bracket.
		if (bracket_table [i].ch == c)	return &bracket_table[i];
		}
	// Character c not found in table, so it isn't bracket character
	return NULL;
}//lookup()

//=============================================================================
// Before we move on, let me show you an alternate way to write the function.
// The version above is clearly a walk through all the Tables in an array.

pTable lookup_pointer_version (char c)
// Using bracket_table, look up the character c given as parameter. If c is
// a bracket listed in the table, function returns pointer to the table
// entry. If c is not a bracket character listed, returns NULL.
{
	int		i;
	pTable	p;		// p is a pointer to a Table

	// Go through all 6 entries in the bracket_table array. Note that this
	// time we initialized i as before, but we also included an initialization
	// of p - to point to the beginning of the array bracket_table. This means
	// p points to bracket_table[0].  Notice also that the update portion of
	// the for loop has two increments - the counter variable i is updated by
	// 1 as before, and the pointer p is also updated "by 1". Incrementing a
	// pointer by 1 is the same as making it point to the next position of
	// of the data type it points to. (So, if one of those structures needs
	// 12 bytes for storage, and p is pointing to - or holds the address of -
	// the first element in the array, then adding 1 - by using the shortcut
	// p++  - effectively adds 12 to the address in p so that it points to
	// the next structure in a set of adjacent structures - which is what an
	// array is.)
	for (i=0, p=bracket_table; i<6; i++,p++)	{
		// check if we found the character we were given. If so, we are
		// done and we can return a pointer to the table entry with the
		// information about the bracket.
		if (p->ch == c)	return p;
		}
	// Character c not found in table, so it isn't bracket character
	return NULL;
}//lookup_pointer_version()

// Why did I do that? It requires less typing (lazy programmer reason) or
// in ancient times it may have created more efficient code (lame reason
// because compiler technology is so advanced, the compiler probably created
// code for the first version equivalent to the second version.
// Here's a question for you - which one do you understand better? Then that
// is the best reason to use the version you're comfortable with.
//=============================================================================

// Stack node definition. In all the previous examples, we pushed simple
// values - like one integer - onto the stack. Here, we are going to push
// more information than a single integer.
// What we push on the stack when we find a bracket is information about
// what kind of bracket we found, and the number of the line we found it in.
// Note I do not record whether it is an OPEN or CLOSE bracket, because I
// should only be storing the OPENs!

// Definition of stack node

	struct _sn			*next;	// pointer to next node - structural info
								// so we can build a linked list.
	enum bracket_types	brkt;	// which kind of bracket did we find?
	int					lineno;	// which line we found it on
};

// Some more shorthand ...
typedef struct _sn	StkNode, *pStkNode;
// This shorthand allows me to use a single name to represent the size of
// the stack node structure. I need the size because I will be malloc()ing
// memory each time I push data.
