// This version collects names from command line. That means,
// the program is used by typing on the command line:
//		readtestv2  file1  file2 ...
// where file1 and file2 are the names of text files

// One function prints out a file, the second
// function takes a file name, and if the file of that name can be
// opened, calls the first function to print it.
//
// This illustrates an idea that we can use functions to encapsulate
// useful functionality, then use that functionality later.
