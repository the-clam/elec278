// Program to read numbers.
// Version 1 was constrained by a fixed aray size. It could not accommodate
// more than 50 items.
// Version 2 is more versatile. It asks the user how many integers, then
// gets enough memory to hold an integer array big enough for that many.
// It does so by using a system routine malloc(). This routine will fetch
// a chunk of memory as big as specified.

void main (void)
{
	int		*pnums;			// pointer to array used to hold what user types

	int		i, j, k;		// useful counters, etc.

	printf ("Tell me how many numbers there are:\n");
	// Here we use scanf to fetch an integer. In reality, the user types some
	// characters, which if scanf recognizes as numeric characters, it converts
	// to an equivalent integer value which is stored in the location pointed
	// to by the parameter. (Syntax &k means "address of k" or "pointer to k".)
	scanf ("%d", &k);
	// The only thing possibly wrong is the user specifying zero or negative

	// So far, so good - let's try to get enough memory. We need room for
	// k integers. malloc() needs to be told how many bytes. How do we figure
	// out how many bytes are needed for an integer? Turns out to be easy -
	// operator sizeof() gives number of bytes needed for its argument. So
	// sizeof(int) gives number of bytes needed for 1 integer.

	pnums = (int *)malloc (k * sizeof(int));

	// Let's examine line above for a moment. malloc is called with a 
	// number - k*sizeof(int). sizeof(int is the number of bytes for one
	// integer, so k*sizeof(int) is enough for k integers - which is what an
	// integer array of size k is. malloc() is used for getting memory to
	// hold anything - and so it returns a void pointer - meaning that its
	// the address of a place in memory, but not associated with any type.
	// We have written (int *) in front of malloc() - this means we know
	// it is going to be used to hold a bunch of integers so we inform the
	// compiler and it doesn't give us any trouble. (int *) is known as a
	// cast.

	if (pnums == NULL)	{
		// malloc() failed - we didn't get memory we wanted. Nothing to do
		// except report it and quit
		fprintf (stderr, "ERROR: Could not get memory for %d integers\n", k);
		exit (EXIT_ERROR);
		}

	// OK - got number of integers, got memory for them - get the integers
	maxindx = k - 1;	// Why? Because k numbers sit in array positions
						// 0 to k-1.
	// Now get all the numbers
	printf ("Now type %d numbers, separated by spaces:\n", k);
	for (i=0; i<=maxindx; i++)	{
		scanf ("%d", &k);
		// Notice the nice C syntax in the next line. I treat the pointer
		// as though it was an array. The array indexing mechanism works and
		// puts each number in its correct place.
		pnums [i] = k;
		}
	// Now print them all out
	printf ("The numbers you typed are:\n");
	for (i=0; i<=maxindx; i++)	{
		if (i>0 && (i % 10) == 0)	putchar ('\n');
		printf ("%6d", pnums [i]);
		}
	putchar ('\n');

	// This next step is unnecessary, since the program is going to exit in the
	// line right after. But, it is a good idea to get into the habit of
	// releasing (freeing) the memory you allocate.
	free (pnums);
