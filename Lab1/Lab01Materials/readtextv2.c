// READTESTV2.C - Lab01 - David Athersych
//
// Program to read text file and write contents to stdout.
// This version collects names from command line. That means,
// the program is used by typing on the command line:
//		readtestv2  file1  file2 ...
// where file1 and file2 are the names of text files

#include <stdio.h>

#define	EXIT_OK		0
#define	EXIT_ERROR	-1


void main (int argc, char *argv[])
// A C program starts by a call to the program's main() function. If the
// function is declared with arguments, then the program has access to the
// "command line" arguments. If a program is started by typing the words
//		cmdname aaa bbb ccc
// then argc has the value 4 (there are 4 words on the line) and argv is
// a pointer to an array of pointers - the first four pointing to strings
// containing "cmdname", "aaa", "bbb", "ccc" and the fifth pointer being a
// NULL pointer.
